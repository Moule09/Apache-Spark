Partition

To allow every executor to work with data in parallel, the data is divided into smaller chunks. These chunks are called partitions.

Transformation

A transformation is an operation or instruction used to modify or transform data.
Examples: select, groupBy, where

Types of transformations:

Narrow: After applying the transformation, each partition contributes to at most one output partition.

Wide: After applying the transformation, each partition can contribute to more than one output partition.

Action

An action triggers the execution of a Spark job.
There are three common types of actions:

View data in console (e.g., show())

Collect data to native language (e.g., collect())

Write data to an output source (e.g., write.csv())

Lazy Evaluation

Spark uses lazy evaluation. It does not immediately execute transformations. Instead, it waits until an action is called to run the computation.

Spark Session

A Spark Session is the driver process and the entry point for Spark execution.

A SparkSession instance is responsible for executing code on the cluster.

The relationship is one-to-one:
1 Spark Application = 1 Spark Session
